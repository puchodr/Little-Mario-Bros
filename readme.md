# Little Mario Bros.

This is meant to be a clone of the original Super Mario Bros. with PICO-8 size limitations. I'm aiming for 1:1 physics, and level design. Not sure on how many levels, I'm hopeful to make the game up to the first castle.

## Features by version
* 0.1 - Collision, movement, and ability to jump.
* 0.2 - Finer tuned movement, additional animations (jumping, skidding, etc.)
* 0.3 - Jump Buffering, near 1:1 physics (Missing water physics and enemy bounce)
* 0.4 - UI, minor death conditions, running animation based on speed and maybe coin collection.
* 0.5 - Block animations (this might require a map overhaul)
* 0.6 - To be continued..
